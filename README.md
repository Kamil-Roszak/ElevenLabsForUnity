# ElevenLabs TTS in your Apps and Games üéôÔ∏è
Hello! :)
I wanted to use the TTS from Eleven for a couple of my own projects in the Unity engine.
Therefore, I thought why not - and will make the code available as open-source :)
If you want to support the project or have any suggestions - feel free :)


# What is Eleven Labs TTS?

[ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) TTS is a cloud-based service offering realistic text-to-speech and voice cloning (and more).

## There will be more stuff here as I add them...
